# Hello-World
Ideas, resources, projects and discussions

Hi, My name is John.  I live in Puerto Rico and have been a graphic designer for the last 20+ years.  I've been designing websites for the last 3 years.  I prefer Wordpress templates because my customer center is small businesses.  Using templates helps me keep my customers costs down and still get great quality design.
